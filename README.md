the reacherv3 class is contained in reacher_v3.py
train_reacher.py file is for training
test_reacher.py is for seeing the train results in the mujoco viewer
sweep.py WAS going to be a seperate script just for observing the best parameters to implement them in train.py later but i failed to make it work
